# StudyPuck Architecture Project

## Project Status: Architecture Design Phase
**Last Updated**: December 22, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Implementation Phase - All architecture decisions complete!

## Project Context
StudyPuck is a hobby project focused on language learning through AI-powered translation drills and spaced repetition cards. The goal is to build a multi-platform application (web-first, then desktop/mobile) with minimal operating costs while learning modern development technologies.

11. **Testing Strategy & Database Operations** → [testing-database-strategy.md](testing-database-strategy.md)
    - **Decision**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest + Playwright, Local Postgres, hybrid auth testing, GitHub Actions CI/CD
12. **UI Testing Guidelines** → [ui-testing-guidelines.md](ui-testing-guidelines.md)
    - **Decision**: Test UI contracts via Vitest component tests first, then Playwright for browser-critical flows

## Current Recommended Stack
Based on completed architecture explorations (Updated January 2026):

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Pure CSS (CUBE methodology)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + Neon Postgres + pgvector
- **AI**: Google Gemini Flash (proxied through Workers)
- **Auth**: Auth0 (OIDC) + Auth.js + 7-day PWA sessions
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright + Neon database branches + hybrid auth testing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages hybrid pipeline
- **Development**: GitHub Codespaces + PNPM + Turborepo monorepo
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (direct GitHub integration)
- **Cross-platform**: PWA initially, Tauri for desktop later
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo with extensible folder structure for web/desktop/mobile apps

## Key Decisions Made
