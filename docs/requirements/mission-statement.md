# Mission Statement

I'm building this project as a way to grow as both a software developer and a language learner.

On the surface, it's a tool to practice translating sentences with the help of an AI tutor. But equally importantly, it's a vehicle for me to learn and explore some key technologies hands-on, namely public cloud, serverless design, modern build and deploy pipelines, LLM-powered apps, and front-end core technologies. I want to show that I can design, build, and evolve my own high-quality application from the ground up.

This is about ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)], making intentional technical choices, and deploying something that works, and that I use in my everyday life as a critical tool. If it helps me improve my own human language studies and assists fellow language learners, that's terrific. If it also demonstrates my continued growth as a technologist and creator and creates opportunities in my career, that's a big plus as well.

## Combine active recall with spaced repetition

Flashcards in a spaced repetition system can be a useful way to learn rote knowledge, especially as they track the "[forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)". However, to really learn to speak the language intuitively, it's necessary to go a lot farther than mere rote memorization and passive recall using flashcards. I need an app that can come up with new sentences with different variations for me to translate. This gets into [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) instead, making me work harder cognitively to apply what I've learned, which is a lot more like actual conversation.

The core value proposition for StudyPuck is to combine the two concepts. I can use a spaced repetition system to surface "cards" (words, phrases, grammar primitives, etc) to study, but an LLM to use the cards as a basis to synthesize sentence after sentence for me to translate into my target language - that's the active recall part.
