# Cards

Cards are the primary study assets owned by the user in StudyPuck. They represent the vocabulary, grammar patterns, and language concepts that form the foundation of your language learning practice.

## Content Types

Cards can contain various types of language learning material:

- **Single words**: Basic vocabulary items
- **Grammar chunks**: Language patterns that form sentence structures
- **Sentence patterns**: Common constructions in the target language
- **Complex prompts**: More nuanced language concepts
  - Example: "Difference between 东西 and 事情"
- **Practical examples**: Real-world usage demonstrations
  - Example: "越来越 (adjective) to express 'more and more...'"

## Structure

Unlike traditional flashcards, StudyPuck cards are structured as study prompts rather than front/back pairs:

- **Study prompts**: Open-ended cues that encourage active recall
- **Multiple example sentences**: Demonstrate usage in context during review
- **Mnemonic prompts**: Personal memory encoding reminders for how you decided to remember a word or concept
- **LLM instructions**: Optional guidance for how the AI should use this card when generating translation sentences
- **Variable length**: Can range from a few words to full paragraph prompts

## Organization

Cards are organized using a flexible grouping system:

- **User-defined groups**: Named collections like "concrete nouns", "grammar patterns", or "common verbs"
- **Language-specific**: Groups are separate for each language being studied. For example a "Storytelling" group would belong to one language, even though another language could have its own "Storytelling" group.
- **Multiple membership**: Cards can belong to more than one group simultaneously. For example, a Card for the word 经历 could belong to a group called "Storytelling" and also "_历 word family" (meaning words ending in the 历 hanzi character).
- **Status management**: Cards can be snoozed, evaluated, or disabled from current study. This status isn't actually tied to the card itself, but to the card's membership in a group or the context of a translation drill study session.

## Card States

Cards have various states that affect how they appear in study sessions:

- **Active**: Available for review and translation drill context
- **Snoozed**: Temporarily hidden from study rotation
- **Disabled**: Removed from current study but preserved in collection
- **Evaluated**: Marked for review timing adjustment based on user performance

## Example Cards

### Word Card example

**经历** - this is both the title and the study prompt itself
- **Type**: word
- **Groups**: storytelling, 经_ word family, _历 word family
- **Meaning**: experience (that one has gone through)
- **Mnemonic**: "Go through here and experience something nice inside, which might not be legal!"
- **Example sentence**: "这次旅行是一次特别的经历。This trip was a special experience."

### Complex prompt Card example

**经历 (experience you go through) vs. 经验 (experience to gain knowledge and skill)**
- **Type**: complex prompt
- **Groups**: storytelling

This organization system allows for flexible study patterns while maintaining clear structure for both systematic review and AI-powered translation practice.
